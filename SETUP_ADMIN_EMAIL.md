## Part 2: Email Notification Setup

### âœ… What's Been Configured

1. **Email Service**: Already configured with Gmail SMTP
   - Host: smtp.gmail.com
   - From: zenosvalkyre@gmail.com
   - Admin notifications: zenosvalkyre@gmail.com

2. **New Expense Notifications**: 
   - When ANY user creates a new expense, an email is sent to the admin
   - Email includes: submitter name, amount, description, date, status

3. **Manager Approval Notifications**:
   - When expense is $100 or more, manager gets notified
   - Only if the employee has a manager assigned

### Email Notification Features

**Admin Email on New Expense:**
```
Subject: New Expense Submitted - [Description]

A new expense has been submitted:

Submitted by: [username] ([email])

Amount: $[amount]

Status: PENDING

Please review this expense in the system.
```

## Testing Email Notifications

1. **Login** to your application (use any employee account)
2. **Create a new expense** through the frontend
3. **Check your email** (zenosvalkyre@gmail.com) - you should receive a notification

### Troubleshooting

If emails are not being sent:

1. **Check Render Logs** for email errors
2. **Verify Gmail App Password** is correct in application.properties
3. **Check spam folder** in your email
4. **Verify email configuration**:
   ```properties
   spring.mail.username=zenosvalkyre@gmail.com

   ```

## User Credentials Summary

| Username | Password    | Role    | Email                    |

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Run the SQL scripts to create admin and manager users
2. âœ… Deploy the updated backend to Render (git push)
3. âœ… Add ADMIN_EMAIL environment variable on Render
4. âœ… Test by creating a new expense and checking email
5. ðŸ“§ Update admin email addresses in SQL if needed

**Note:** The email notification is sent asynchronously, so it won't slow down the expense creation process.
